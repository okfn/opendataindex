So, the 5-days forecast of temperature updated daily for districts only.\r\n 2. Generally, there are summaries provided on strong winds and rough seas (http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4963). There are no 5-days forecast of wind updated daily.\r\n 3.

The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the ZCTA isn\u2019t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.\r\n\r\n### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS\r\n\r\nThe full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.\r\n\r\nThe ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.\r\n\r\n \"You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to \u201cZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)\u201d and not simply to ZIP Codes\u2122. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries.

The latter is a restrictive proprietary license (http://adresse.data.gouv.fr/static/pdf/BAN%20Licence%20de%20repartage.pdf).

It exists in two versions of the base and the first one is the one that is taken into account in this submission (and not in the previous one). We believe this BAN ODBL version can be accepted as an official source because:\r\n- A link to the ODBL version of the BAN, distributed by OSM France, is provided on an official & governmental website: https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/download/ (second link at the bottom of the page) according to the terms of the official BAN convention signed between IGN, La Poste, Etalab and  OSM France http://openstreetmap.fr/f/Convention%20BAN%2015%20avril%202015%20SCAN%20SIGNE.pdf\r\n- the data have the same source than the second version mentionned in the previous comment and is formated at and by Etalab (Prime Minister office for open data and open gov) \r\n\r\nPREVIOUS COMMENT FROM REGARDS CITOYENS : \r\n\r\nThe previously registered \"Base officielle des codes postaux\" by La Poste <https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-officielle-des-codes-postaux/> does not match the new requirements as it only provides openly an association of zipcodes with ciies.\r\nSome cities have multiple zipcodes, so even by associating the data with the opened administrative borders database GEOFLA <http://professionnels.ign.fr/geofla>, we would not be able to get coordinates corresponding to zipcodes.\r\n\r\nAlthough another database could fulfill the requirements to a larger extant : the national address database BAN that gives coordinates for all addresses including their zipcodes.

The Data Selector http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave \"The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns.\"). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual *emissions* of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications.

Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch.

But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only \"images\" and \"graphics\". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for \"No\", and only about 20% for \"yes\".

Roshydromet operates a system for the prompt identification and investigation of dangerous ecotoxicological consequences of emergencies. A system of global baseline environmental monitoring is maintained in Russia, and six integrated monitoring stations are located in biosphere reserves. Air quality monitoring is undertaken by the Institute for Global Climate and Ecology, which prepares the annual Survey of the Pollution of the Natural Environment in the Russian Federation http://www.igce.comcor.ru; and the Russian Aerospace Agency (Rosaviakosmos), which developed a system for environmental monitoring in space http://www/rosaviakosmos.ru. Air pollution monitoring is carried out in more than 350 Russian cities. It covers all major industrial centres and almost all cities with a population of over 100,000. The system includes 1,200 stations for monitoring air pollution in cities and other settlements. Around 4 million samples are analysed annually for more than 20 air pollutants. According to long-term observations, in more than 75 percent of Russian cities maximum concentrations of air pollutants (dust, CO, NO2, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, phenol) exceed established limits. Thus air quality in most Russian cities does not comply with established sanitary and hygienic norms. - See more at: http://www.greenpackonline.org/english/environmental-components.php?id=01-06-07-04#sthash.2EJ4mckw.dpuf\r\n\r\nits seem the google map is not working  to see the monitor site\r\n\r\n\r\nalso the city of Moscow have Air Quality monitoring system\r\nhttp://www.mosecom.ru/air/air-today/"}, {"place": "cl", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "8", "score": "70", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.mma.gob.cl/retc/1279/channel.html", "format": "XLS,CSV", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": "National Information System on Air Quality", "publisher": "Ministry of Environment", "timestamp": "2015-08-27T15:04:41", "submitters": "Diego Ignacio", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "all type of Pollutant is been monitoring  except of VOCs"}, {"place": "pt", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "8", "score": "70", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://qualar.apambiente.pt/index.php?page=1", "format": "XLS", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": "European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register", "publisher": "European Commission", "timestamp": "2015-09-20T22:38:20", "submitters": "Ricardo Lafuente", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "all Pollutant are measured\r\ndata can be download with web interface in xls format\r\nVOCs = C6H6(Benzene)"}, {"place": "ie", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "8", "score": "70", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "https://www.epa.ie/air/quality/data/", "format": "xlsx, JSON", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": "Environmental Protection Agency", "timestamp": "2015-10-07T15:43:55", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked\r\nfrom i understand its look like open sorce data \r\nbut i see that note was send to To examine the issue\r\n\r\nhis data is open data and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).\r\n\r\nThis means you are free to: Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the data in any medium or format; Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the data for any purpose, even commercially.

It concluded that Doha had the 12th highest average levels of small and fine particles, known as PM2.5, which can penetrate the respiratory tract and increase the risk of respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart disease and stroke.\r\n\r\nAccording to the US Environment Protection Agency, these particles \u2013 which often cannot be seen with the naked eye \u2013 are made up of heavy metals and toxic organic compounds, and originate from vehicle exhaust, smelting plants and the burning of organic materials.\r\n\r\nLarger particles \u2013 PM10 \u2013 are mostly caused by dust and smoke. In this category, Doha ranked just outside the top 30.\r\n\r\nStandards\r\n\r\nWhile the ministry\u2019s recent report didn\u2019t benchmark Qatar against other countries, it showed that local air pollution levels frequently exceed the WHO\u2019s recommendations as well as Qatar\u2019s own targets, which are more lax than the international standards.\r\n\r\nFor example, Qatar\u2019s national air quality standards for PM10 are 150 ug/m3 for 24 hours average concentration and 50 ug/m3 for the annual average concentration.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the WHO\u2019s standards for PM10 are 50 ug/m3 for the 24-hour average \u2013 one third of Qatar\u2019s target \u2013 and 20 ug/m3 for the annual average concentration, which is less than half of the national figure.\r\n\r\nThe MDPS report uses statistics from the Ministry of Environment, which measures air quality at three monitoring stations in Doha \u2013 at Qatar University, Aspire Zone and the M\u00f6venpick Hotel on the Corniche.\r\n\r\nLevels highest at QU\r\n\r\nAll three monitoring stations recorded pollution levels above the recommended national and global levels. However, concentration levels of the larger particulates (PM10) were highest at QU station in the north of Doha. That location also recorded the most days when air quality levels did not meet international standards.\r\n\r\nAir Quality study - fig14In 2012, the national quality standards were breached on 159 days, or 44 percent of the year\r\n\r\n[http://dohanews.co/qatars-air-quality-fails-standards-159-days-year/][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://dohanews.co/qatars-air-quality-fails-standards-159-days-year/"}, {"place": "gt", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "54", "score": "35", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": "Programa De Calidad Del Aire De INSIVUMEH Para La Rep\u00fablica De Guatemala", "publisher": "INSIVUMEH", "timestamp": "2015-10-01T15:48:29", "submitters": "Julio Herrera", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "Air Pollution are Measured \r\n[enter link description here][1]\r\nbut the raw data Air Pollution is not Exist\r\nwaht  Exist  is Air Pollution index(ICA) that is base on the raw data\r\nso the data is not Considered Exist Online\r\nin the usa the epa give the raw data and index data so the data is open \r\n\r\ninfo on AIR QUALITY INDEX  of Guatemala(google Translate)\r\n\r\nAIR QUALITY INDEX (ICA)\r\nThe results are on the map of the country and in other sections of this website are referred to as Index Air Quality (ICA), which is an indicator of how clean or polluted the air at the site of measurement associated the health effects that people may experience in a few hours or days after breathing that air.\r\nThe ICA is calculated according to the established form of calculation for the AQI (Air Quality Index) of the EPA, and while not have a national law governing the matter, it will be based on the standards of air quality provided equally by EPA, considering the following parameters: ozone, particles, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.\r\nThe ICA ranges from 0 to 500, where 500 represents the highest level of contamination and therefore the highest risk to health.

These guidelines have been derived from available scientific and human health data, and basically represent \"safe levels\" below which no adverse health effects have been observed. The MAAGs are generally comparable to the corresponding air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization and other countries. \r\n\r\nThe averaging time, which varies from 1 to 24 hours for the different air pollutants in MAAGs, represents the period of time over which measurements is monitored and reported for the assessment of human health impacts of specific air pollutants. As such, the air pollution indices are normally monitored and reported for the same averaging times as those employed for the air quality standards/guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe API values are reported for varying averaging time as follows: \r\n\r\na) PM10 and SO2 on 24-hour running averages.\r\nb) CO on 8-hour running averages.\r\nc) NO2 and O3 on 1-hour running averages.\r\n\r\nThe API for PM10 reflects specifically levels of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micron pollution and it may not be linked directly to visibility factors, as visibility is often determined by results of semi-quantitative observations over relatively shorter time periods. \r\n\r\nThe API value reported for a given time period represents the highest API value among all the sub-APIs calculated during that particular time period. The predominant parameter contributing towards a particular API value is normally indicated alongside the API value. This approach is an effort to promote a uniform and comparable API system. Ideally, all sub-API values exceeding the API 100 threshold limit should also be reported in addition to the predominant API value per se. \r\n\r\nTo determine the API for a given time period, the sub-index values (sub-API) for all 5 air pollutants included in the API system are first calculated using the above mentioned sub-index functions for the air quality data collected from the Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAQMs).

In order to accomplish this mission, the Agency must be able to evaluate the status of the atmosphere compared to clean air standards and historical informations. That's why the NAEP established since 1996 an Air Quality Monitoring Network (AQMN) composed by thirteen permanent monitoring stations, two mobiles laboratories and a data elaboration centre with the aim of characterizing human health exposure and public impacts of conventional pollutants. In Tunisia, that extends over 163900 km\u00b2 and includes 24 metropolitans towns, there are several permanent monitoring stations located in many towns like Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Gab\u00e8s Tozeur, Kef. In this paper, some stations of Tunisia and its monitoring networks have been selected as representative sites of the investigated area. In Tunis, the selected monitoring stations were located in Traffic area (Bab Saadoun), in urban area (El Mourouj) and in a suburban area (Nahli). Each station is provided with automatic analyzers of O 3 , NOx, SO 2 , PM10, CO and with meteorological sensors such as temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction. Nitrogen oxides, NO and NO 2 , were analysed using the chemiluminescence method. The measurement of ozone is based on the capacity of such gases to absorb ultraviolet rays with opportune wavelengths, generated by built-in lamp. Carbon monoxide CO is analyzed infrared rays absorption (IR). The measurement of PM10 is based on the beta ray attenuation method while SO 2 is analysed using a fluorescence method. For all parameters, the data are collected by the monitoring network every hour. The data were validated according to this protocol: first, a preliminary validation was carried out by the software, which invalidated all the data occurred in calibration hours and the data identified as artifacts then a manual calibration was carried out by the operators, considering the relations among the parameters. This way it is possible to verify that eventual critical data are related to real pollution situations.

These payments requests collectively are known as the Payments Information Repository, or PIR. Treasury promised in 2012 testimony to the Senate that it would publish the PIR as open data, but has not fulfilled the promise (and the DATA Act doesn't require it to).\n\nDetails on Treasury's PIR promise are here: http://datacoalition.blogspot.com/2012/07/senate-hearing-illuminates-need-for.html\n\nBecky Sweger - National priorities project\nAfter a GAO audit (http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-476) of USASpending.gov was published this summer, HHS agreed to start submitting aggregated Medicare spending data. I can confirm that Medicare benefits payments are showing up now (they didn't as of a few months ago), but didn't confirm the data are complete.\nIf Medicare benefits are now represented in USASpending.gov, it's likely no longer true that the site represents \"only a small part of federal spending data.\" I'd re-reword to \"So while the data are available, they represent an incomplete picture of federal spending that does not include government salaries, benefits, and other operating expenditures.\"\nAgency procedures for reporting money paid to (or on behalf of) individuals are inconsistent. The Social Security Administration has always done a great job of reporting. HHS finally decided to aggregate and report Medicare. USDA, however, doesn't accurately report food stamp benefits in USASpending.gov. Since this type of payment represents the largest chunk of U.S. spending, it's important to have consistent and enforced guidelines for reporting.\n\n\n2013 comments: The data at USASpending.gov accounts for only a fraction of all government spending, and it is organized in a way that makes it hard to understand and use. So while the data are available, it's only a small part of federal spending data. It does not include expenses on government salaries and operating expenditures or information on Medicare, the nation's government sponsored medical insurance for the elderly (~20% of total spending). There are no government-wide spending records that would actually be more helpful --- that is, the government doesn't collect the type of data about its own spending that would be useful to the open government world. \n\nThe data available at USAspending.gov comes from a variety of sources and is presumably licensed based on the original source licenses: http://usaspending.gov/learn?tab=Sources%20of%20Data"}, {"place": "md", "dataset": "spending", "year": "2014", "rank": "15", "score": "10", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "No", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-11-30T16:01:57", "submitters": "Tryggvi Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "reviewers": "Daniela Mattern", "reviewcomments": "Expert review accepted", "details": "There is aggregated data for spending data, but not not on a monthly basis or per transaction."}, {"place": "tw", "dataset": "spending", "year": "2014", "rank": "15", "score": "10", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "No", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-11-30T15:59:53", "submitters": "Tryggvi Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "reviewers": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewcomments": "Data is not transactional, but aggregated.

The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.\n\nIn addition, the ZCTA isn\u2019t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.\n\n### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS\n\nThe full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.\n\nThe ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.\n\n \"You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to \u201cZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)\u201d and not simply to ZIP Codes\u2122. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries. Designed by the U.S. Postal Service for use in mail delivery, ZIP Codes represent carrier routes made up of individual addresses.

The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

Base website is http://pravo.gov.ru - this project is being maintained by Federal Security Service (FSS) and this website is keystone for Russian laws disclosure. A few serious issues exists with Russian laws:\n1. No machine readable data\n2. No bulk download\n3. No open licenses for laws\n4. Government websites not integrated with pravo.gov.ru instead they provide links to the commercial providers of laws information like Russian companies \"Consultant\" (http://consultant.ru) and \"Garant\" (http://www.garant.ru).\n5. Laws published on many of government websites available as \"high quality scanned images\". Step by step explanation\n1. Does the data exist? Yes, at http://pravo.gov.ru 2. Is data in digital form? Yes, data available via website pravo.gov.ru 3. Publicly available? Yes, this data is publicly available. We don't need FOI request to get it. 4. Is the data available for free? Yes, this data is available for free. No payment is required. 5. Is the data available online? Yes. Data available at http://pass.rzd.ru 6. Is the data machine readable? No, it's only HTML pages. 7. Available in bulk? No, data is not available for bulk download 8. Openly licensed? No, this data is public domain data but no open license available. 9. Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis?\nYes, this information updated frequently, on daily basis. Special comment from Ivan Pavlov: we consider the Russian legislation as open licensed, taking into the account Russian Legislation provisions. Russia has no special license for government data and we should consider the legal regime of data use and dissemination form \"the common rule\" point of view. According to the Civil \u0421ode of Russia (Article 1259), official government documents including laws, other legal texts, judicial decisions, other materials of legislative, administrative and judicial character are not objects of copyright. According to the Russian FOI law (Article 4), one of the main FOI principles in Russia is the freedom to seek, receive, transmit and disseminate information on activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government in any legal way. Also according to the Russian FOI law (Article 1), information about the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government is information (including documentation), established within government bodies, their territorial bodies, local authorities or institutions subordinate to the state authorities, local self-government (hereinafter - organizations subordinated to it), or received by the mentioned bodies and organizations. Information on the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government also includes laws and other normative legal acts concerning information on the activities of bodies of local self-government \u2013 municipal legal acts defining structure, competence, formation and operating procedures of the above-specified bodies and organizations, and other information concerning their activity. Thus, according to the current Russian legislation, there are no legal restrictions on use, reuse or redistribute legislation data."}, {"place": "bm", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.bermudalaws.bm/default.aspx", "format": "PDF", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-10-09T14:23:59", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": ""}, {"place": "pt", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://dre.pt/index.html", "format": "PDF", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": "1910", "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-10-04T08:23:06", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": ""}, {"place": "sn", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.jo.gouv.sn/", "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-05-17T14:51:15", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "Only a small part is available in digital format."}, {"place": "lt", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "Unsure", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www3.lrs.lt/dokpaieska/forma_l.htm", "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-02-23T11:38:00", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "The legislation is available, however, mostly in .doc format"}, {"place": "se", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Unsure", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": "http://62.95.69.15/sfs/sfst_form2.html", "format": "txt", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-02-21T18:04:32", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "Unstructured text data for now.

Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch. But regional government rarely publish pollution monitoring information and pollution sources. I know only a few public data sources available like Mosecomonitoring (Moscow ecological survey). But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only \"images\" and \"graphics\". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for \"No\", and only about 20% for \"yes\". The only available sources: - http://dynamic.igce.ru/ (not up to date) - pollution monitoring and radiation monitoring (by Rosatom) - http://www.russianatom.ru/ I suggest this dataset for following review. \n\n\nStep by step explanation\n1. Does the data exist?   \nYes, here it is http://www.mnr.gov.ru/upload/iblock/96e/gosdoklad%2020_07_2013.pdf as report and a few other sources available.\n\n2. Is data in digital form?   \nYes, data available via website(-s)\n\n3. Publicly available?   \nYes, this data is publicly available. We don't need FOI request to get it.\n\n4. Is the data available for free?   \nYes, this data is available for free. No payment is required.\n\n5. Is the data available online?   \nYes. Data available at http://pass.rzd.ru\n\n6. Is the data machine readable?   \nNo, it's not machine readable. Only HTML and PDF files\n\n7. Available in bulk?   \nNo, data is not in bulk\n\n8. Openly licensed?   \nNo, this data is public domain data but no open license available.\n\n9. Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis?\nNo, data is not published timely.
