Main documents are in PDF but some raw data is also provided in Excel format. However this does not usually include detailed departmental budgets. Departmental level budgets are in a number of places, but the two collections available regularly free of charge under the UK Open Government Licence are: (1) the annual ""Estimates"" published each April for the financial year commencing that April. These are published in PDF format department by department and are at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-main-estimates for the last three years 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14. This dataset is ""up to date"" (2) the same, and some more detailed, data is contained in the ""Plans"" part of the COINS/OSCAR dataset http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins (this also contains matching expenditure information). Although the expenditure information is published quarterly, the ""plans"" are not currently published in COINS data until the end of the financial year to which they relate. Once Plans information is available on COINS it is available for bulk download in machine readable format (CSV). In assessing the ratings fairly it was necessary to choose between the ""Estimates"" and ""COINS"" versions - the COINS version seemed closer to the ideal, even though it was not as up to date, and that is assessed here."

Postal codes can also be found at: http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Privat/Kundeservice/postnummerkort/Sider/home.aspx QA question: Please explain how to obtain the data required for this item of the census according to the definition above. The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

Yes, this information updated frequently, on monthly basis. Ivan Pavlov: Ivan Pavlov: we consider the Russian statistics as open licensed, taking into the account Russian Legislation provisions. Russia has no special license for government data and we should consider the legal regime of data use and dissemination form ""the common rule"" point of view. According to the Civil Сode of Russia (Article 1259), official government documents including laws, other legal texts, judicial decisions, other materials of legislative, administrative and judicial character are not objects of copyright. According to the Russian FOI law (Article 4), one of the main FOI principles in Russia is the freedom to seek, receive, transmit and disseminate information on activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government in any legal way. Also according to the Russian FOI law (Article 1), information about the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government is information (including documentation), established within government bodies, their territorial bodies, local authorities or institutions subordinate to the state authorities, local self-government (hereinafter - organizations subordinated to it), or received by the mentioned bodies and organizations. Information on the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government also includes laws and other normative legal acts concerning information on the activities of bodies of local self-government – municipal legal acts defining structure, competence, formation and operating procedures of the above-specified bodies and organizations, and other information concerning their activity. Thus, according to the current Russian legislation, there are no legal restrictions on use, reuse or redistribute statistics data."

We tried to find this data many times but it's not centralized and most likely unavailable as unified dataset. Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch. But regional government rarely publish pollution monitoring information and pollution sources. I know only a few public data sources available like Mosecomonitoring (Moscow ecological survey). But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only ""images"" and ""graphics"". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for ""No"", and only about 20% for ""yes"". The only available sources: - http://dynamic.igce.ru/ (not up to date) - pollution monitoring and radiation monitoring (by Rosatom) - http://www.russianatom.ru/ I suggest this dataset for following review.

Comments by Lorena Rivero - 29/10/2013
My name is Lorena Rivero, in charge of the open budget site in Mexico. Going through the index you recently published, I found some information ranked as ""Unsure"", specifically in the part of Government Spending where it says ""I don't find detailed information about the spending on an eg. monthly basis"".

In this matter I would like to show that we have extensive information in a monthly basis, including income, showing the different taxes and oil income; expenditure in administrative, functional and economic classifications; debt; grants; local government transfers among many other information in http://www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx/ptp/contenidos/?id=5. All data can be consulted and downloaded (in xls) free of charge according to the terms and conditions stated in the site (Términos y Condiciones de uso de la información) allowing the user to create its own time series and receive the data in different ways, for example in millions, accumulative or percentage of the GDP.

Additional Comments from consulted civil society specialists - 10/11/2013
An initial revision with civil society specialists was done in november 2013. Specialists were not certain that all expenses can be found in a detailed monthly basis. Nonetheless, a more detailed research and comparison with other countries should be done for 2014 census."

Transport timetables is one of most common issues here in Russia Timetables managed not by federal, but by regional and local governments. Each regional and local governments publish with several issues: 1. Data is not always published online 2. Data is not always up to date 3. Data is not available as open data 4. No open licenses 5. Measurement of openness of transport data is very limited since it's not concentrated anythere. But rail transport schedules and most airports are public so timetables available. Step by step explanation
1. Does the data exist? Yes, national level transport timetables available at http://pass.rzd.ru - it's Russian rail data 2. Is data in digital form? Yes, data available via website and has digital form. 3. Publicly available? Yes, this data is publicly available. We don't need FOI request to get it. 4. Is the data available for free? Yes, this data is available for free. No payment is required. 5. Is the data available online? Yes. Data available at http://pass.rzd.ru 6. Is the data machine readable? No, this data provided only as HTML pages 7. Available in bulk? No, this data provided only as HTML pages so it's not available in bulk. 8. Openly licensed? No, this data is owned by federal state enterprise and it's not even public domain data. 9. Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis?
Yes, this information updated frequently, on hourly basis. Ivan Pavlov: Despite the fact, that there is copyright sing on the http://pass.rzd.ru, according to the Russian Civil Code (article 1259) information about facts with purely informational character, including the schedule of transport, can not be the object of copyright. Thus, proceeding from the General rule, there are no legal restrictions for use or reuse of information about the schedule of railway transport."

Looking at rail where there is an interstate system, similar to the UK, Australia has a nationally supported rail system in which the actual service is provided by private operators (but track is publicly owned and maintained). Similar to the UK, there are therefore good public interest grounds for the government to require provision of timetable data. Focusing on rail then there is no consolidated database of timetable information - instead you are directed off to each rail companies website where you must do your own lookup using a classic HTML interface. As such it is clear the data exists and is online but is not machine-readable, not in bulk and based on the notice on various websites not open (for example, Transport West Australia's train website has a classic fully restrictive copyright notice at http://www.transwa.wa.gov.au/Default.aspx?tabid=113)"

• If you require more detailed data than that in the ‘Generalised Data’ you will need to contact Digital Sales in Ordnance Survey Ireland (http://www.osi.ie/) and obtain a licence for the OSI Discovery Series Vector Water Lines dataset (inclusive of Rivers and Lakes). There is a fee for this, however, I do not know what it is.

The Data Selector http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave ""The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns.""). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual *emissions* of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications. Some complete datasets are available as open data, notably from Defra: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs/series/air-quality-and-emissions-statistics.

Base website is http://pravo.gov.ru - this project is being maintained by Federal Security Service (FSS) and this website is keystone for Russian laws disclosure. A few serious issues exists with Russian laws:
1. No machine readable data
2. No bulk download
3. No open licenses for laws
4. Government websites not integrated with pravo.gov.ru instead they provide links to the commercial providers of laws information like Russian companies ""Consultant"" (http://consultant.ru) and ""Garant"" (http://www.garant.ru).
5. Laws published on many of government websites available as ""high quality scanned images"". Step by step explanation
1. Does the data exist? Yes, at http://pravo.gov.ru 2. Is data in digital form? Yes, data available via website pravo.gov.ru 3. Publicly available? Yes, this data is publicly available. We don't need FOI request to get it. 4. Is the data available for free? Yes, this data is available for free. No payment is required. 5. Is the data available online? Yes. Data available at http://pass.rzd.ru 6. Is the data machine readable? No, it's only HTML pages. 7. Available in bulk? No, data is not available for bulk download 8. Openly licensed? No, this data is public domain data but no open license available. 9. Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis?
Yes, this information updated frequently, on daily basis. Special comment from Ivan Pavlov: we consider the Russian legislation as open licensed, taking into the account Russian Legislation provisions. Russia has no special license for government data and we should consider the legal regime of data use and dissemination form ""the common rule"" point of view. According to the Civil Сode of Russia (Article 1259), official government documents including laws, other legal texts, judicial decisions, other materials of legislative, administrative and judicial character are not objects of copyright. According to the Russian FOI law (Article 4), one of the main FOI principles in Russia is the freedom to seek, receive, transmit and disseminate information on activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government in any legal way. Also according to the Russian FOI law (Article 1), information about the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government is information (including documentation), established within government bodies, their territorial bodies, local authorities or institutions subordinate to the state authorities, local self-government (hereinafter - organizations subordinated to it), or received by the mentioned bodies and organizations. Information on the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government also includes laws and other normative legal acts concerning information on the activities of bodies of local self-government – municipal legal acts defining structure, competence, formation and operating procedures of the above-specified bodies and organizations, and other information concerning their activity. Thus, according to the current Russian legislation, there are no legal restrictions on use, reuse or redistribute legislation data."

I argue that it is not available in bulk as, although the option is available to list all registered companies in all geographical regions and across all sectors, the table it displays only show the company name and a selected geographical unit (either sub-district, city/district, and province name but not all three), and does not include the sector/field it is associated with.

No, data disclosure is not well organized. Budget portal is still beta. Ivan Pavlov: we consider the Russian Budget Information as open licensed, taking into the account Russian Legislation provisions. According to the Civil Сode of Russia (Article 1259), official government documents including laws, other legal texts, judicial decisions, other materials of legislative, administrative and judicial character are not objects of copyright. Also according to the Russian FOI law (Article 1), information about the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government is information (including documentation), established within government bodies, their territorial bodies, local authorities or institutions subordinate to the state authorities, local self-government (hereinafter - organizations subordinated to it), or received by the mentioned bodies and organizations. Information on the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government also includes laws and other normative legal acts concerning information on the activities of bodies of local self-government – municipal legal acts defining structure, competence, formation and operating procedures of the above-specified bodies and organizations, and other information concerning their activity.
Thus, according to the current Russian legislation, there are no legal restrictions on use, reuse or redistribute budget data."

(Do note that is does not include postcodes that are not connected to geolocations, such as PO Boxes) See for a detailed description of the search for the Dutch postcode data; http://www.zylstra.org/blog/2013/10/theoretically-open-post-codes-not-so-much-in-practice/"
