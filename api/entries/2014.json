Similar to the UK, there are therefore good public interest grounds for the government to require provision of timetable data. Focusing on rail then there is no consolidated database of timetable information - instead you are directed off to each rail companies website where you must do your own lookup using a classic HTML interface. As such it is clear the data exists and is online but is not machine-readable, not in bulk and based on the notice on various websites not open (for example, Transport West Australia's train website has a classic fully restrictive copyright notice at http://www.transwa.wa.gov.au/Default.aspx?tabid=113)"}, {"place": "sl", "dataset": "companies", "year": "2014", "score": "10", "rank": "74", "isopen": false, "exists": "Y", "digital": "Y", "public": "?", "online": "?", "free": "?", "machinereadable": "?", "bulk": "?", "openlicense": "?", "uptodate": "?", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-11-26T21:00:10.239Z", "submitters": "Pierre Chrzanowski", "reviewers": "Katelyn Rogers", "details": "You can register a company online through the Office of the Administrator and Registar General's website so presumably the data is exists and is digital - http://www.oarg.gov.sl/"}, {"place": "at", "dataset": "budget", "year": "2014", "score": "55", "rank": "44", "isopen": false, "exists": "Y", "digital": "Y", "public": "Y", "online": "Y", "free": "Y", "machinereadable": "N", "bulk": "Y", "openlicense": "N", "uptodate": "Y", "url": "https://www.bmf.gv.at/budget/das-budget/budget-2014-2015.html", "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": "Federal Ministry of Finance", "timestamp": "2014-11-21T11:02:58.255Z", "submitters": ["Robert Harm", "Mathias Huter", "Ton Zijlstra"], "reviewers": ["Robert Harm", "Ton Zijlstra", "Lieke Ploeger"], "details": "https://www.bmf.gv.at/budget/das-budget/budget-2014-2015.html provides links to the budgets for 2014 and 2015 in PDF files.

Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.\n\nIn addition, the ZCTA isn\u2019t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.\n\n### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS\n\nThe full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.\n\nThe ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.\n\n \"You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to \u201cZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)\u201d and not simply to ZIP Codes\u2122. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries. Designed by the U.S. Postal Service for use in mail delivery, ZIP Codes represent carrier routes made up of individual addresses. A true representation of ZIP Codes would separate out individual housing units and releasing data for them would risk disclosing personally identifiable information\". https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=10488\n\nThe ZCTAs are not the same as the (regularly updated) USPS postal code lookup files or the postal code database with addresses and Lat Long.

The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

These payments requests collectively are known as the Payments Information Repository, or PIR. Treasury promised in 2012 testimony to the Senate that it would publish the PIR as open data, but has not fulfilled the promise (and the DATA Act doesn't require it to).\n\nDetails on Treasury's PIR promise are here: http://datacoalition.blogspot.com/2012/07/senate-hearing-illuminates-need-for.html\n\nBecky Sweger - National priorities project\nAfter a GAO audit (http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-476) of USASpending.gov was published this summer, HHS agreed to start submitting aggregated Medicare spending data. I can confirm that Medicare benefits payments are showing up now (they didn't as of a few months ago), but didn't confirm the data are complete.\nIf Medicare benefits are now represented in USASpending.gov, it's likely no longer true that the site represents \"only a small part of federal spending data.\" I'd re-reword to \"So while the data are available, they represent an incomplete picture of federal spending that does not include government salaries, benefits, and other operating expenditures.\"\nAgency procedures for reporting money paid to (or on behalf of) individuals are inconsistent. The Social Security Administration has always done a great job of reporting. HHS finally decided to aggregate and report Medicare. USDA, however, doesn't accurately report food stamp benefits in USASpending.gov. Since this type of payment represents the largest chunk of U.S. spending, it's important to have consistent and enforced guidelines for reporting.\n\n\n2013 comments: The data at USASpending.gov accounts for only a fraction of all government spending, and it is organized in a way that makes it hard to understand and use. So while the data are available, it's only a small part of federal spending data. It does not include expenses on government salaries and operating expenditures or information on Medicare, the nation's government sponsored medical insurance for the elderly (~20% of total spending). There are no government-wide spending records that would actually be more helpful --- that is, the government doesn't collect the type of data about its own spending that would be useful to the open government world. \n\nThe data available at USAspending.gov comes from a variety of sources and is presumably licensed based on the original source licenses: http://usaspending.gov/learn?tab=Sources%20of%20Data"}, {"place": "es", "dataset": "postcodes", "year": "2014", "score": "10", "rank": "42", "isopen": false, "exists": "Y", "digital": "Y", "public": "N", "online": "N", "free": "N", "machinereadable": "N", "bulk": "N", "openlicense": "N", "uptodate": "N", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-12-03T17:40:38.152Z", "submitters": ["Mor Rubinstein", "Jaime Soler", "Pierre Chrzanowski", "Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Onta\u00f1\u00f3n"], "reviewers": ["Mor Rubinstein", "Maria Dotor", "Pierre Chrzanowski"], "details": "Postcode data are available without georeference and under licence fee here http://www.correos.es/ss/Satellite/site/pagina-1349169615030/info"}, {"place": "tn", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2014", "score": "35", "rank": "52", "isopen": false, "exists": "Y", "digital": "Y", "public": "Y", "online": "Y", "free": "Y", "machinereadable": "N", "bulk": "N", "openlicense": "N", "uptodate": "N", "url": "http://www.anpe.nat.tn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=175&Itemid=184&lang=fr", "format": "PDF", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-11-26T21:35:22.058Z", "submitters": ["Rayna St", "Amin Khechine"], "reviewers": ["Rayna Stamboliyska", "Rayna St"], "details": "PDF Reports published in the official website of the National Agency for Environment Protection from 2005 to 2008.

But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only \"images\" and \"graphics\".
